-  Filename slugs: keep filenames simple ^1
	- They are UNIQUE, and don't change them
		-  if you do handle redirects properly
	 - don't join words together 
	- use a dash to replace whitespace and periods
	- remove special characters and quotes or replace with dash/hyphen (`-`)
	- don't capitalize
	- add a Trailing slash `/` at the end (optional)
	- make them relevant to content and similar to title
	- keep them as short as practical
	- Remove unnecessary words, but don't forget about human readability
		- remove words like `[a, the, and, is, on, do, of]`
	- try to use keywords, but 
		- Don't keyword stuff (overload)
		- aim for relevant long-tail keywords
		- for ecommerce include product and category words
	- ==Before you publish check your slug, and keywords==
