Here is my recipe for paleo Dijon mustard:

## Ingredients:

-   1/4 cup ground mustard seed
-   1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
-   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
-   1 teaspoon raw honey (optional)
-   1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
-   1/2 teaspoon sea salt

## Instructions:

1.  In a small bowl, whisk together the ground mustard seed, apple cider vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, raw honey (if using), garlic powder, and sea salt until well combined.
2.  Transfer the mixture to a small jar or container with a tight-fitting lid.
3.  Refrigerate the mustard for at least 1 hour before using to allow the flavours to meld together.

This paleo Dijon mustard is a great condiment to have on hand for sandwiches, marinades, dressings, and sauces. It's also free of preservatives and additives that are often found in store-bought versions. Enjoy!
