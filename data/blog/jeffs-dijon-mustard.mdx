Here is my recipe for paleo Dijon mustard:

## Ingredients:

- 1/4 cup ground mustard seed
- 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- 1 teaspoon raw honey (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon sea salt

## Instructions:

1.  In a small bowl, whisk together the ground mustard seed, apple cider vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, raw honey (if using), garlic powder, and sea salt until well combined.
2.  Transfer the mixture to a small jar or container with a tight-fitting lid.
3.  Refrigerate the mustard for at least 1 hour before using to allow the flavours to meld together.

This paleo Dijon mustard is a great condiment to have on hand for sandwiches, marinades, dressings, and sauces. It's also free of preservatives and additives that are often found in store-bought versions. Enjoy!

## Information

### Ground Mustard seed or mustard powder?

Ground mustard seed and mustard powder are similar, but they are not exactly the same thing. Ground mustard seed is made by grinding whole mustard seeds, while mustard powder is made from ground mustard seeds that have been sifted to remove the larger particles, resulting in a finer powder.

The texture and potency of the two products can be slightly different due to the varying particle sizes. Ground mustard seed tends to have a slightly coarser texture and a stronger, more pungent flavour than mustard powder. Mustard powder, on the other hand, has a smoother texture and a slightly milder flavour.

Both ground mustard seed and mustard powder can be used in recipes interchangeably, but it's important to keep in mind the differences in texture and potency when substituting one for the other.
