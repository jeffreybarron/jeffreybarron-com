## Information

Sweet chili sauce is a condiment with a rich history that has its origins in Southeast Asia. The sauce is made from red chili peppers, sugar, vinegar, and garlic, and it's commonly used as a dipping sauce for dishes like spring rolls and fried chicken.

The exact origin of sweet chili sauce is uncertain, but it's believed to have originated in Thailand or Vietnam. In Thailand, it's known as "nam chim kai," which means "dipping sauce for chicken." It's a staple condiment in Thai cuisine and is typically served with grilled or fried chicken.

In the 1980s, Thai cuisine became popular in the United States, and sweet chili sauce gained a following in American households. The sauce was introduced to the American market by Huy Fong Foods, a California-based company founded by Vietnamese immigrant David Tran.

In recent years, there has been a growing trend of making homemade sweet chili sauce. Recipes for homemade sweet chili sauce can be found online, and many people enjoy making their own sauce to control the level of spiciness and sweetness.

Overall, sweet chili sauce has become a beloved condiment around the world, including Australia. Its popularity is a testament to the delicious flavor and versatility of this sauce.
