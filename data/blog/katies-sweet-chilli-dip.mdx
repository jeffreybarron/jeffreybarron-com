## Information

In the 1980s, Thai cuisine became popular in the United States, and sweet chilli sauce gained a following in American households. The sauce was introduced to the American market by Huy Fong Foods, a California-based company founded by Vietnamese immigrant David Tran. Huy Fong Foods is best known for its Sriracha hot sauce, but the company also produces a sweet chilli sauce that has gained a loyal following.

Today, sweet chilli sauce is widely available in Australian supermarkets and is used in various dishes, from stir-fries to salads. The sauce has also become popular in other parts of the world, including Europe.

In recent years, there has been a growing trend of making homemade sweet chilli sauce. Recipes for homemade sweet chilli sauce can be found online, and many people enjoy making their own sauce to control the level of spiciness and sweetness.

Overall, sweet chilli sauce has become a beloved condiment around the world, including in Australia. Its popularity is a testament to this sauce's delicious flavour and versatility.
