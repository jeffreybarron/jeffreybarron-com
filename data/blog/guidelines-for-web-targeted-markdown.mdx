## Filename / Slugs

- keep filenames simple ^1
	- They are UNIQUE, and dont change them
		- if you do handle redirects properly
	 - dont join words together
	- use a dash to replace whitespace and periods
	- remove special characters and quotes or replace with dash/hyphen (`-`)
	- dont capitalize
	- add a Trailing slash `/` at the end (optional)
	- make them relevant to content and similar to title
	- keep them as short as practical
	- Remove unnecessary words, but dont forget about human readability
		- remove words like `[a, the, and, is, on, do, of]`
	- try to use keywords, but
		- Dont keyword stuff (overload)
		- aim for relevant long-tail keywords
		- for ecommerce include product and category words
	- **Before you publish check your slug, and keyword SEO**

## Frontmatter Example  

All elements are required and need to be correct, or the build will break.

## Adding images to markdown  
- I don't have a simple way to refactor obsidian links or [[wikilinks]] to create a suitable Next/Image Component, therefore, I am adding a  react component into the markdown document.
- A consequence of this is all markdown with image attachments need to be .mdx files
- Also for some reason Next/Mdx needs there to be be a line break between the last bit of markdown and the component.
- Use this template to link to images 
- It can be VERY helpful to also add a double space after all React Components and markdown links.

``` js
<Image
 src={`/images/blog-attachments/__IMAGE__`}
 alt={`__TEXT__`}
 aria-label={`__TEXT__`}
/>  
```
