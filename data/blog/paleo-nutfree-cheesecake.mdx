Cheesecake is a classic dessert that is loved by many, but it's often high in carbs due to its crust and sugar content. However, if you're following a low-carb diet and have nut allergies, you don't have to miss out on this delicious treat. This low-carb cheesecake recipe is easy to make and free from peanuts or tree nuts.

## Ingredients

- 240g coconut flour
- 56g butter, melted
- 3 packages (720g) of cream cheese, softened
- 220g granulated low-carb sweetener (such as erythritol or monk fruit)
- 4 large eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 60ml heavy cream

__Note:__ Heavy cream is commonly known as thickened cream. It is a cream with a milk fat content of around 35% and is often used in cooking and baking to add richness and thickness to sauces, soups, and desserts.  

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 165 °C (325 °F). Grease a 23cm springform pan with butter or cooking spray.   
2. Combine the coconut flour and melted butter in a medium mixing bowl. Stir until the mixture forms a coarse crumb.  
3. Press the mixture into the bottom of the prepared springform pan using a flat-bottomed cup or your fingers. 
4. Bake for 10–12 minutes or until golden brown.    
5. In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and sweetener until smooth.    
6. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition, then stir in the vanilla extract and heavy cream.    
7. Pour the cheesecake mixture over the crust in the springform pan. Smooth the top with a spatula.    
8. Bake for 50–60 minutes or until the cheesecake is set around the edges and slightly jiggly in the centre.    
9. Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool inside the oven, with the door open slightly, for 30 minutes.    
10. Remove the cheesecake from the oven and run a knife around the edges to loosen it from the pan.    
11. Chill the cheesecake in the fridge for at least 2 hours, or overnight, before slicing and serving.  

Enjoy your delicious, low-carb cheesecake! This recipe is perfect for special occasions or just as a treat for yourself, with no peanuts or tree nuts.
