Here is a recipe for paleo mayonnaise along with the ingredients you'll need:

## Ingredients:

- 1 egg
- 1 cup light olive oil
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt (6g)
- 1/2 teaspoon of Jeff's Dijon mustard [^1]
- sweetener (optional)
  - 1/2 teaspoon honey or,
  - 1/2 teaspoon erythritol or stevia (Low Carb)

## Instructions:

1.  Crack the egg into a blender or food processor.
2.  Add the apple cider vinegar, salt, dijon mustard, and sweetener to the blender.
3.  Turn the blender on low speed and slowly drizzle in the light olive oil.
4.  Continue blending until the mixture is thick and creamy, which should take about 1-2 minutes.
5.  Taste the mayo and adjust the salt and acidity to your liking.

**Note:** It's important to use light olive oil instead of regular olive oil because the flavor of regular olive oil can be too strong and overpowering in this recipe.

Once you've made your paleo mayonnaise, you can use it as a condiment for sandwiches, burgers, or as a base for salad dressings and dips. Enjoy!
