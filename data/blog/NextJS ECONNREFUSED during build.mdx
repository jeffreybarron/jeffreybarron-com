# NextJS ECONNREFUSED during build


`TL;DR` dont call your own API for getStaticPaths()

[^Attribution] Copied from Stackoverflow for my convenience.  

When run `npm next build`, NextJS iterates all the pages that it can build statically. i.e. those without getServerSideProps, but which possibly define getStaticProps and getStaticPaths.

To build those pages, Next calls getStaticPaths to decide which pages you want to build, and then getStaticProps to get the actual data needed to build the page.

Now, if in either of getStaticPaths or getStaticProps you do an API call, e.g. to a JSON backend REST server, then this will get called by next build.

However, if you've integrated both front and backend nicely into a single server, chances are that you have just quit your development server (next dev) and are now trying out a build to see if things still work as sanity check before deployment.

So in that case, the build will try to access your server, and it won't be running, so you get an error like that.

The correct approach is, instead of going through the REST API, you should just do database queries directly from getStaticPaths or getStaticProps. That code never gets run on the client anyways, only server, to it will also be slightly more efficient than doing a useless trip to the API, which then calls the database indirectly

You should then only do client API calls from the React components on the browser after the initial pages load (i.e. from useEffect et al.), not from getStaticPaths or getStaticProps. BTW, note that as mentioned at: What is the difference between fallback false vs true vs blocking of getStaticPaths with and without revalidate in Next.js SSR/ISR? reducing client calls as much as possible and prerendering on server greatly reduces application complexity.
