This cheatsheet is a work in progress, I thought it might be useful at some point, so the code here is just some placeholder really.

```javascript
// How to create variables:
var x;
let y;

// How to use variables:
x = 5;
y = 6;
let z = x + y;

const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.sort();
fruits.reverse();
```
